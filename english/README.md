Common linking verbs are:  
    _look_, _smell_, _feel_, _taste_, and _sound_.  
<!-- }}} -->

## Indirect objects <!-- {{{ -->

### General <!-- {{{ -->
Some verbs are followed by two objects: a dire ct object and an indirect
object.  

+ I wrote _a letter_ **_to Alex._**  
+ I wrote **_Alex_** a letter.  

(a) and (b) have the same meaning.  
The preposition **_to_** is not used when the indirect object is first
and the direct object is second.  

A direct object answers the question _What?_  
    What did you write? &rarr; A letter.  
An indirect object answers the question _Who(m)?_  
    Who(m) did you write a letter to? &rarr; Alex.  
When the direct object is pronoun (e.g. _them_), it must precede the
indirect object, as in (f).  
    Did you write a letters to Alex?  
    Yes, I did. I wrote **_them to him_**.  

Verbs followed by indirect objects introduced by **_to_**:  

|        |         |
| ---    | ---     |
| _give_ | _send_  |
| _hand_ | _show_  |
| _lend_ | _tell_  |
| _pass_ | _write_ |
<!-- }}} -->

### Indirect objects: using for <!-- {{{ -->
With some verbs, **_for_** is used with the indirect object. With these
verbs, the indirect object follows the direct object. **_For_** is not
omitted. The position of the indirect object is not changed.  

+ Bob opened _the door_ **_for Mary_**.  
+ Sue answered _a question_ **_for me_**.

Notice in the examples: All of the sentences give the idea that someone
is helping another person.  

Verbs followed by indirect objects with **_for_**:  

+ _answer_ - He _answered_ a question **_for me_**.  
+ _cash_ - The teller _cashed_ a check **_for me_**.  
+ _fix_ - Can you _fix_ my car **_for me_**?

+ _pronounce_ - I _pronounced_ the word **_for the students_**.  
+ _translate_ - I _translated_ a letter **_for my brother_**.  
<!-- }}} -->

### Indirect objects with buy, get, make <!-- {{{ -->
With the berbs **_buy_**, **_get_**, and **_make_**, two patterns are
possible:  

+ **_for_** introduces the indirect object, or  
    Tina **_bought_** _a gift_ **_for us._**  
+ the indirect object precedes the direct object.  
    Tina **_bought us_** _a gift._  
<!-- }}} -->

### Indirect objects with explain and introduce <!-- {{{ -->
With the verbs **_explain_** and **_introduce_**:  

+ **_to_** is used with the indirect object, and  
    The teacher **_explained_** the grammar **_to us_**.  
+ the indirect object always follows the direct object.  
    Incorrect: _She explained us the grammar._  
<!-- }}} -->
<!-- }}} -->

# Adjectives and adverbs <!-- {{{ -->
+ An adjective describes a noun.  
    Ann is a **_careful_** driver.  
+ An adverb describes the action of a verb.  
    Add drives **_carefully._**  

Most adverbs are formed by adding **_-ly_** to an adjective.  

The adjective form and the adverb form are the same for:
**_fast_**, **_hard_**, **_early_**, **_late_**.  

**_Well_** is the adverb form of **_good.\*_**  

+ Linda is a **_good_** writer.  
+ Linda writes **_well._**  

\* **_Well_**can also be used as and adjective to mean "not sick." _Paul
was sick last week, but now he's well._  
<!-- }}} -->

# Making Comparisons <!-- {{{ -->

## Comparisons: using the same (as), similar (to), and different (from) <!-- {{{ -->

    * C and D are **_similar._**  
    * C is **_similar to_** D.  
+ **_different (from)_**  
    * E and F are **_different._**

<!-- }}} -->

## Comparisons: using like and alike <!-- {{{ -->
**_like_** = _similar to_  
**_alike_** = _similar_  
**_Like_** and **_alike_** have the same meaning, but the sentence
patterns are different:  

+ This + **_be_** + **_like_** + that  
    You pen **_is like_** my pen.  
+ This and that + **_be_** + **_alike_**  
    Your pen and my pen **_are alike._**  
<!-- }}} -->

## The comparative: using -er and more <!-- {{{ -->
When we use adjectives (e.g., _old_, _important_) to compare two people
or two things, the adjectives have special forms:  

+ adjectives tiwh one syllable &rarr; add **_-er_**
    Mary is **_older than_** John.  
    Spelling note: if an a djective ends in one vowel and one consonant,
    double the consonant: big-bigger.  
+ adjectives that end in _-y_ &rarr; change the **_-y_** to **_i_** and
  edd **_-er_**  
    pretty &rarr; prettier  
+ adjectives with two or more syllables &rarr; use **_more_** in fron of
  adjectives  
    Health is **_more important than_** money.

    good-better; bad-worse; far-farther/further  

Notice in the examples: **_than_** follows the comparative form.  
<!-- }}} -->

## Using as ... as; using less <!-- {{{ -->
**_as_** _adjective_ **_as_** have the meaning of "same in respect of
adjective"  
John is 21 years old. Mary is 21 years old. John **_is as old as_**
Mary.  

**_Less_** is the opposite of **_more_**. **_Less_** is usually not used
with one-syllable adjectives or adjectives that end in **_-y_**.  

+ This book **_is less expensive than_** that book.  
+ Incorrect: _Fred is less old than Jean._  
+ Correct: _Fred isn't as old as Jean._  
+ Correct: _Fred is younger than Jean._  
<!-- }}} -->

## Using but <!-- {{{ -->
**_But_** gives the idea that "This is t he opposite of that."  
    John is rish, **_but_** Mary is poor.  
A comma usually precedes **_but_**.  
  
Often the verb phrase following **_but_** is shortened, as in the
examples.  

+ John **_is_** rich, _but_ Mary **_isn't._**  
+ Mary **_isn't_** rich, _buy_ John **_is._**  
<!-- }}} -->

## The superlative: using -est and most <!-- {{{ -->
The comparative **_(-er/more)_** compares two things or people.  
The superlative **_(-est/most)_** compares three or more things or
people.  

+ adjectives with one syllable:  
  **_old_** &rarr; **_older_** _(then)_ &rarr; **_the oldest_** _(of
  all)_  
  **_big_** &rarr; **_bigger_** _(then)_ &rarr; **_the biggest_** _(of

  all)_  
  **_bad_** &rarr; **_worse_** _(than)_ &rarr; **_the worst_** _(of all)_  
  **_far_** &rarr; **_farther/further_** _(than)_ &rarr; **_the
  farthest/furthest_** _(of all)_  
<!-- }}} -->

## Using one of + superlative + plural noun <!-- {{{ -->
The superlative often follows **_one of_**.  
Notice the pattern: **_one of_** + _superlative_ + _plural noun_  

+ The Amazon is **_one of the longest rivers_** in the world.  
+ A Rolls Royce is **_one of the most expensive cars_** in the world.  
<!-- }}} -->

## Using as ... as with adverbs <!-- {{{ -->
Notice the pattern in the examples:  
**_as_** + _adverb_ + **_as_**  

+ Bob doesn't study **_as hard as_** his brother (does).  
+ I didn't finish my work **_as quickly as_** Sue (did).  

Notice the patterns in the examples:  
**_as_** + _adverb_ + **_as_** is frequently followed by
_subject_ + **_can/could_** or by **_possibly._**

+ I'm working **_as fast as I can._**  
+ I'm working **_as fast as possible._**  
+ Alex came **_as quicly as he could._**  
<!-- }}} -->

## Making comparisons with adverbs <!-- {{{ -->
Use **_more_** and **_most_** with adverbs that end in **_-ly\*_**.  

+ Kim speaks **_more fluently than_** Ali (does).  
+ Anna speaks **_the most fluently of all._**  

Use **_-er_** and **_-est_** with irregular adverbs: **_hard, fast,
early, late_**:  

+ Mike worked **_harder than_** Sam (did).  
+ Sue worked **_the hardest of all._**  

**_Better_** and **_best_** are forms of the adverb _well_.

+ Rosa writes **_better than_** I do.  
+ Kim writes **_the best of all._**  

\* Exception: _early-earlier-earliest_

# Part of speech

## Participle I
Participle is a word formed from a verb. It can be used as verb, noun or
adjective.  
To form a present participle, you start with the base verb. Next, you
add "ing" to the end of the base verb.  

### As a compund verb:
> My baby sister _is_ **crying** because she's hungry.  

+ Remember that present participles form compound verbs with forms of
  the auxiliary verb "be"  

### As an adjective:
> Mom got up to soothe the **crying** baby.  


## Participle II (or past participle)
It is used to describe an action that happened in the past. It can
also be used as adjective.  
To form it take base verb and create third form.  

### As a compound verb:
> Jordan _had_ **kicked** the ball into his neighbor's yard.  

+ Remember that past participles form compound verbs with the auxiliary
  verbs "has", "have" and "had"  

### As an adjective
> Jordan went into the yard to get the **kicked** ball.  


## Gerund
Gerund are formed from verbs but act as nouns. They're created by adding
"ing" to theirs tail.  
**Examples:**  

+ **Swimming** in the ocean has been Sharon's passion since she was five
  years old.  
+ Let's go **dancing** at the club tonight.  


# Part of sentence

## Conditional
A conditional sentence tells the "conditions" in which something
happens. It shows a possible cause and effect situation in the form of
an "if...then" staatement.  

**Structure:**  
| Conditional Clause | Main Clause                    |
| ---                | ---                            |
| If you want        | I can go with you to the store |


### "Real" Conditionals (Zero Conditional)
Real conditionals are sentences expressing the real conditions for
things that happen, not hypothetical things.  

**Present simple tense:**  
> He cleans if I cook  

**Present continuous + Present simple**  
> If it is snowing, we don't drive  

**Present continuous + Present continuous**  
> If he is staying, I am going  

**Past simple + Past simple**  
> If it snowed, we never drove  

**Past simple + Past continuous**  
> We always made swonmen if it was snowing  


### First conditional
The first conditional shares the result of situation in the future that
we think is pretty likely to happen.  
**If <present simple> + future tense:**  
> If I sleep now, I will be up all night.  


### Second conditional
The second conditional shows possible outcomes that could occur in the
present or future, if specific conditions exist.  
**If <past simple> + future tense:**  

+ If you slept until 3pm, you shouldn't be tired  
+ If you did well on the SATs, you will get accepted  
+ If you wanted to avoid traffic, you could take the highway  
+ If he ate all the cookies, you would have to bake more  


### Third conditional
The third conditional lets us express that if something could happen,
other things could happen as well.  
**If <past perfect> + would have + <verb>**:(_you can also use other
modals instead of would_)  

+ If you had gone to bed earlier, you would have been well rested.  
+ If you had taked the highway, you oculd have avoided traffic.  
+ If you had made more cookies, we might have had enough.
